## Introduction

Each folder is named after a package and contains every configuration file used by that application.
Besides some noted exceptions, the files inside the folders are relative to home (e.g. the file `vim/.vimrc` goes to `~/.vimrc`).

Every section here explains which settings and (if any) workarounds/fixes are used to obtain the described result.

For further reference, read carefully every section in this file, and copy only the configuration files relative to the parts you are trying to setup.

If something still doesn't work as expected, check:

- [Issues](https://github.com/avivace/dotfiles/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aopen) of this repo where someone else may have/had the same problem:
	+ [Notification handling, Plasma wallpaper not disappearing](https://github.com/avivace/dotfiles/issues/2)
- [Here](https://avivace.com/blog) you can find some blog entries where I describe more fixes and workarounds to problems appeared while using this setup / Debian.

If none of these helped, feel free to open an issue here. Include your distro informations and the configuration values you are trying.

## Desktop
X, Plasma, i3, compton

### i3 + Plasma integration

I'm using **KDE Plasma** as Desktop Environment + **i3-gaps** as (tiling) Windows Manager. Without having to use patches to either i3 or KDE - just with some tuning - everything works out of the box, including:

- the **Pager** widget (which correctly reads and lets you switch i3 workspaces)
- the **Icons-only Task Manager** (~dock) widget (opens for you the corresponding workspace when clicking an icon)
- other plasmashell widgets and popups
- multiple displays
- everything offered by i3 (including window focusing, shortcuts and mouse-related things)

You will still use the Plasma session with `startx`, so set your login manager accordingly.

350 MB base RAM consumption, compositor included.

Please note that i3 will replace KWin completely, so you won't have titlebars and every other compositing/animation feature offered by a standard Plasma installation.

#### Disabling the Plasma Desktop and the Plasma Wallpaper

The Plasma wallpaper is rendered at the top, hiding everything. Disable the autostart of `ksplashqml`:

```
sudo mv /usr/bin/ksplashqml /usr/bin/ksplashqml.old
```

Finally, in the i3 configuration we use `wmctrl` to kill the Plasma desktop view:
 
```
exec --no-startup-id wmctrl -c Plasma
for_window [title="Desktop — Plasma"] kill; floating enable; border none
```

### i3 Urgent workspace feature

A possible solution, in the i3 configuration:

```
force_display_urgency_hint 0 ms
focus_on_window_activation urgent
```

See [#13](https://github.com/avivace/dotfiles/issues/13).

#### Wallpaper

The wallpaper is set with `feh` in the i3 configuration, as startup command.

#### Glitched tooltips

If you notice something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ef4gjZX.png), compton maybe the problem, try disabling the `fade` effect:

```
wintypes :
{
	tooltip : 
	{
#    fade = true;
	 shadow = false;
	 opacity = 0.75;
	 focus = true;
	};
};
```

### Status Bar

It's a fully transparent Plasma panel, themed with the [Arc T](https://github.com/avivace/Arc-T) desktop theme.
The [awesome-widgets](https://github.com/arcan1s/awesome-widgets) plasmoid shows the following content:

```html
<div align="right" style="color:#ffffff; font-family:'Helvetica Neue'; font-size:12pt;">$hddfreegb0G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$cpu%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$memgbG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$temp0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $custom1</div>
```

Where `$custom1` runs `bat.sh`. Depends on `FontAwesome`.

### Launcher

Rofi (themed in X/`.Xresources`), started in i3 with `bindsym $mod+d exec --no-startup-id i3-dmenu-desktop --dmenu='rofi -i -dmenu -width 40 -lines 8 -font "San Francisco Display 18"'`.

### Typography

Font rendering settings are in the `X` folder. Typefaces in bold are in my current setup, while the others are appreciated alternatives I like to periodically switch to.

**Sans Serif**, UI:

- Helvetica Neue
- IBM Plex Sans
- San Francisco Display
- **Inter**

**Monospaced**, text editors and shells:

- **SF Mono**
- Monaco
- Hack
- Input
- Iosevka

**Serif**:

- Libre Baskerville

### Compositor

The compositor of choice is [`picom`](https://github.com/yshui/picom). With the `--experimental-backends` it gives good results on 4K/60Hz setups.

### Notifications

System notifications are handled by Plasma. If you don't see them correctly, check if you have another notification daemon installed (e.g. `dunst` which comes as recommended package for `i3` in some distros).

## Applications

### Terminal Emulator

The entire detailed configuration of the browser is in `User.js`, with settings to improve privacy, limit tracking and fingerprinting, disable unwanted features (based on [pyllyukko/user.js](https://github.com/pyllyukko/user.js/) and [ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/)).
